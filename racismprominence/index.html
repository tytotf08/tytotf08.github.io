			<p>Racism is an issue that has stained the American life since the very creation of it; and even before. Sports' roads have been paved by this very issue; it has influenced us like nothing else. From Kentucky High Schools to Flushing Meadows; even prominent, if not more, in a time where interaction itself is now a daring action; it spreads like the sunset, and creeps up behind us before snatching it all away. Pulling us into darkness. </p>
			<p>Naomi Osaka, a Haitian-Japanese tennis player, has been one of the more recent sensations in tennis. She won the 2018 Indian Wells, beating the world no. 1 at the time. Amongst rage over sexism, and an ignited US Open crown, she powered her way past the legendary Serena Williams. 2019 began faster than a Mclaren for her, but slowed down immediately. However, a lackluster few months was brought to a halt by a race to the finish during the Western and Southern Open, a lead up event to the US Open. She pulled out of the final from injury. And, two weeks and quite a few forehands later, she claimed the US Open once more. But this time, she had a more passionate determination that aided her; a message. She wore the names of victims of police brutality on her mask, and in a predominantly white sport, reminded the world that before she's a tennis player, she's "a black woman." And this message was indeed significant. It showed that the effects of racism were felt across many places, that the secluded sport of tennis felt it. But it wasn't just tennis; the most ordinary of normal institutions had racism. </p>
			<p>In Kentucky, a high school has recently lifted a hairstyle ban. Aforementioned ban prevented many natural Black hairstyles, and ones that were part of their culture. Students had felt "personally attacked" as it was a part of their culture; hence it comprised a bit of their identity.  Another school, in another one of the 50 states of America had racism ingrained in its structure, however unnecessary. And COVID-19, the novel Coronavirus, has highlighted more instances of systemic racism.</p>
			<p>Mere health benefits may place Black people at a disadvantage. A lack of too many goings-on and the focus upon healthcare showed us that the success rate for Black women delivering babies was much lower than that of a white person. Many more people are getting the virus in places "undervalued" and ignored; and the majority of those people are Black. Their economic disadvantage is now even more major than times prior. The scrappiness of our fight against COVID-19 leaves these "less important" Black people stuck, and treated like afterthoughts. Just like how tennis never really acknowledged the mistreatment of Black people until Naomi Osaka stood up; and the organisers followed suite due to the cash she generates. It takes that.</p>
			<p>Three major frontiers, more different than silver to a pebble, are all united in acknowledging and feeling the effects of racism; and fighting it. </p>
