				<h1>Hello,</h1>
				<p>is it kind of obvious that the button to the right is the name I prefer to use on the internet? I wonder if that spoils what it is. I dunno, but anyways, it's my internet name. That's the courtesy you have to implicate on these profile-kind sites? So...
				</p>
				<p>the name comes from my favorite kind of owl, the Tyto Aurantia of New Zealand. "tf08" just visually appeases me, so that explains the rest of it. 
				</p>
				<p>I am (kind of?)  able to code, at least to the point where I can make the text you're reading right now.</p>
				<p>Really, the only large-scale, actually nightly updated project I'm developing right now is TarEditor. You can see to the right the link to it, but it's a JavaScript text editor; also stated in the link. Right now it has rudimentary special character handling and line numbers, and I think that "modes" would be something good to implement. For instance, mode-mark would be markdown/html special text scanning. Seems compelling enough, I guess?</p>
