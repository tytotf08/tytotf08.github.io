			<h1>Hello,</h1>
			<p>is it kind of obvious that the button to the right is the name I prefer to use on the internet? I wonder if that spoils what it is. I dunno, but anyways, it's my internet name. That's the courtesy you have to implicate on these profile-kind sites? So...
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>the name comes from my favorite kind of owl, the Tyto Aurantia of New Zealand. "tf08" just visually appeases me, so that explains the rest of it.</em> 
			</p>
			<p>I like programming, and in particular, I like using the web as my chalkboard. Hence, the majority of the repositories I have on Github are mostly HTML or JS or CSS.</p>
			<p>As mentioned before, I really like owls. I think that they're just so... cool, in their own sneaky way. I also play tennis, and I think I can hit the ball over the net, so yeah. In terms of programming, this, a node.js language, and a JS-based editor are my only serious projects. I'm obsessed with Dragon Ball, and I have two Bandai Figure-Rise Model Kits and one SH Figuarts. </p>
