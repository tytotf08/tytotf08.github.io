	<hr/>
	<p>xCelerate JS is a tool that you can use to generate full styled web-pages with no knowledge of coding at all, using the version called xcelerate-min.js, where there are preassigned stylings for you. If you are more experienced, there is xcelerate.js, the full-flown version where you can apply as much styling as you want. We recommend using CDN, so know work will be needed to update your xCelerate Version.</p>
