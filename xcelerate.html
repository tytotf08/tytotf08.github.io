	<hr/>
	<p>xCelerate JS is a tool that you can use to generate full styled web-pages with no knowledge of coding at all, using the version called xcelerate-min.js, currently in development at the original repo of xCelerate JS. If you are more experienced, there is xcelerate.js, the full-flown version where you can apply as much styling as you want. We recommend using CDN, so know work will be needed to update your xCelerate Version. Go to github.com/tytotf08/xcelerate.js to find the repository. You will find instructions there.</p>
